# IP Subnet Practice

A simple CLI tool used for generating subnetting problems. Intended for students to practice.

## How to install

Just compile from source (until a makefile is made or something)

## How to use

You can just run the program from the terminal, which writes to standard output. Alternatively you can use pandoc to save the output to a file.

`./ipsp | pandoc -f textile -o subnet-practice.pdf`

This runs the program, and saves its output to a pdf.
